 <h1>Welcome! <br/></h1>

  <p>This repo is for my journey with various practices in my Java course.</p>

  
  <h2>Module 1</h2>
<p>A simple object-oriented application that uses primitive data types, arithmetic, selection, repetition, and relational operators. The rectangle class shows allows for the computation of area for length x width and the circle class uses radius.  </p>

<h2>Module 2</h2>
<p>Wrote an application that tracks loans based on the needs of a fictional business. The application also calculates the total amount owed at the due date (original loan amount + loan fee) as well as the total amount that the company has loaned out in each category and in total.</p>
<p>The Loan class includes a loan number, customer's last name, amount of loan, interest rate, and term. The Loan constants include the different terms while the interest varies based on business and personal loans.</p>

<h2>Module 3</h2>
<p>A Java application that divides two values and outputs the result. Prompts the user to enter two integers from the keyboard and divide the first value by the second value. This outlines practice throwing and catching an ArithmeticException when it attempts to divide by zero.</p>
<p></p>

<h2>Module 4</h2>
<p>The objective is to demonstrate the behavior of threads that share data and use synchronized methods. This is a model of a race between a tortoise and a hare. Added an eat method synchronized, and observe the different behavior if the eat method allows the hare to begin eating before the tortoise is done eating.</p>
<p></p>

<h2>Module 5</h2>
<p>Demonstrating the Collections interface by sorting an ArrayList using the method Collections.sort. Output the sorted List. Shuffled the list, and outputted the shuffled list. </p>
<p></p>

<h2>Module 6</h2>
<p>Practiced generics and demonstrated it working with arrays of at least three different types and parameters.</p>
